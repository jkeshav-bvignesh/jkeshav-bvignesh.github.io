									<p align = "justify">I currently work as a Software Development Engineer in the Autonomous Robots Research Team (Smart Devices) at CTO, Wipro Limited. I am currently involved in the design and development of scalable and configurable robotic software modules. I primarily code in Python and mostly work with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and supporting software including Gazebo, Moveit! and RViz. I also design robot simulation environments to aid software development and testing.<br />
I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2018. During this period, I had designed and developed a few robot prototypes including an AI powered Chessboard. I have worked in several projects in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Game Theory.<br />
Other than computer science I am also passionate about performing magic and being involved in films.I directed one short film and have worked as the script writer in many individual projects. I have also worked as a VFX/Graphics Designer and am proficient in skills involving video editing.</p>

									<h3>Notable Projects</h3>
									<p> Experience is the best teacher. Learning new stuff is easier and more interesting when we build as we learn. A few of my notable projects are described below. Please visit <a href = "https://www.github.com/jkeshav-bvignesh/"> my github profile</a> to see all my works.</p>

												<h4>AI Powered Chessboard</h4>
												<p align = "justify"><i>Website:<a href = "https://vitcapstoneproject.wordpress.com/"> vitcapstoneproject.wordpress.com/</a></i><br>
This is my Final Year Capstone Project. The project involves designing a cost effective prototype for a chessboard that the user can play against. Unlike existing pick and place chess playing robots, the prototype was designed to be a single portable unit with no visible mechanisms that move chess pieces. Everything is taken care of under the hood. Thus it doesn't ruin the feel of a chessboard for a player. The website discusses the various issues involved and mechanisms and prototypes designed to achieve the goal.</p>

												<h4>Room temperature control and monitoring System using Deep Learning</h4>
												<p align = "justify"><i>Tools Used: Python, SQLite, Raspberry Pi, HTML5, JQuery, Bootstrap, Flask</i><br>
This system learns the user preferences, using Deep Learning Techinques and then predicts the optimal
temperature. The user can change the preferences and monitor the system statistics using a website from
any location</p>

												<h4>Tamil Handwritten Character Recognition using Deep Learning</h4>
												<p align = "justify"><i>Tools Used: Python, TensorFlow, JQuery, Bootstrap, Flask</i><br>An interactive website wherein the user can write characters of the Tamil language. The website gives the recognition probabilities based on the character they have written using
convolutional neural networks. The website can also be used to gather more training data from people who know the language</p>

												<h4>A game theoretical approach to solve Network Congestion</h4>
												<p align = "justify"><i>Tools Used: C++, NS2</i><br>A game theoretical approach is proposed to resolve network congestion among competing flows. An optimal and fixed congestion window size is allocated to each node in the network at the end
of the game.</p>
