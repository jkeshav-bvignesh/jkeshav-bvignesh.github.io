I currently work as a Software Development Engineer in the [Robotics team at Wipro](https://www.wipro.com/en-IN/innovation/robotics/), building the core software platform modules for our applications and also dabbling in some frontend development every once in a while.

### My Tech Stack
I primarily code in Python, while also developing some components in Java and C++. I have also worked significantly with the Robot Operating System (ROS). I also develop web user interfaces for the various applications using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and frameworks like JQuery and Angular. I constantly explore new domains and am currently looking at Game development. You can find more details about my professional experience in my [Resume](/CV/J_Keshav_Bhupathy_Vignesh_Resume.pdf). I also work on side projects in my free time. You can find out more about those [here](/personal-projects)

### Other Interests
I am a hobbyist magician and perform occasionally. I am also an avid cinephile and love watching & discussing films and tv shows. I also make short films once in a while.
