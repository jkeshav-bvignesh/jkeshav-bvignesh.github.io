---
A Software Engineer and Roboticist by profession, I have been primarily involved in building Intelligent & Autonomous Collaborative Robotics systems (static and mobile manipulators, drones) and its associated Microservices, System and Web-apps.

My experience ranges from designing the State Machines that control the individual robots and simulations at a micro level to working on the system and Microservices architecture to Orchestration at a high level.

Robotics has given me the opportunity to apply my knowledge in the fields of Graphics, AI, System/Web dev and Game design. This field is a culmination of many computer science disciplines and I have been fortunate enough to work on most. If you look more closely, you realise that Robotics is essentially real world gaming as there is a significant overlap of concepts!

### Tech And Storytelling
Storytelling has evolved over the centuries and it is obvious that the next evolution is going to be intertwined with tech. A personal interest of mine has been about exploring how Robotics, AI, Mixed Reality and games will change the Storytelling landscape ( I am a cinephile and amateur film-maker). I have been writing about these changes in the series: ["Tech Behind Storytelling"](/blog/tbs)

### My Tech Stack
I work on the complete spectrum of things from UI, to backend to DevOps. I primarily code in Python, building things from Robot Orchestration Systems to System Apps to Microservices, while also developing some components in Java and C++. I also develop web user interfaces for the various applications using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and frameworks like JQuery and Angular. I have also worked significantly with the Robot Operating System (ROS).

I have also started exploring Game Development as there is a significant overlap with Robotics and it's ability to tell immersive stories. I also work on [side projects](/blog/personal-projects) in my free time. Feel free to contact me in case you need more details about my professional experience.

### Other Interests
I am a hobbyist magician and perform occasionally. I am also an avid cinephile and love watching & [discussing films and tv shows](blog/watchlist/). I also make short films once in a while.
