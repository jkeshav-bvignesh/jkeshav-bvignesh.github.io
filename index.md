I love to create elegant software. What do I mean by that? Efficiently designed and written software that doesn't get in your way to achieve what you want to do. There is a certain beauty to software where everything just falls into place. 

From user experience to system design to performance, software engineering is filled with a lot of interesting challenges and new opportunities to learn. It's an exciting field to be in and I am always up for discussions on software design, code quality and building interesting projects! I also write about stuff that I find interesting, technical and otherwise, [here](/blog).

### My Tech Stack
I work on the complete spectrum of things from UI, to backend to DevOps. I primarily code in Python, building both System Apps and Microservices, while also developing some components in Java and C++. I also develop web user interfaces for the various applications using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and frameworks like JQuery and Angular. I have also worked significantly with the Robot Operating System (ROS). 

I constantly explore new domains and am currently looking at Game development. You can find more details about my professional experience and skillset in my [Resume](/CV/J_Keshav_Bhupathy_Vignesh_Resume.pdf). I also work on [side projects](/blog/personal-projects) in my free time.

### Other Interests
I am a hobbyist magician and perform occasionally. I am also an avid cinephile and love watching & [discussing films and tv shows](blog/watchlist/). I also make short films once in a while.
