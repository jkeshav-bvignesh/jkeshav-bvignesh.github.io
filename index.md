### Brief Intro
A Computer Science & Engineering Major and a Full Stack Software Engineer & Roboticist by profession, I have been primarily involved in building Intelligent & Autonomous Collaborative Multi-Agent Robotics systems (static and mobile manipulators, drones) with AI Planning (Automated Planning and Scheduling), Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

My experience ranges from programming individual robots to designing end-to-end  Multi-Agent Collaborative workflows that incorporate Perception, Intelligence, Resource Optimization and Real-time Decision Making. I also build the associated REST Microservices, Single Page Web-Apps and DevOps pipelines to package these research concepts as real world products. I have spearheaded the development of two Robotics Platforms that have been at the core of various solutions developed by our team at [Wipro's Robotics Practice.](https://www.wipro.com/innovation/robotics/)

My research interests include Human-Robot Interaction & Collaboration, Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, Multi Agent Systems and Computer Graphics. I am really passionate about developing the next generation of Human-Centric Interactive technologies and bringing them to the real world as accessible, affordable solutions.
### Other Interests
I am a hobbyist magician / mentalist and perform occasionally. I am also an avid cinephile and love watching & [discussing films and tv shows](https://www.instagram.com/celluloidjourneys/). I also make short films once in a while.
##### Tech And Storytelling
Storytelling has evolved over the centuries and it is obvious that the next evolution is going to be intertwined with tech. A personal interest of mine has been about exploring how Robotics, AI, Mixed Reality and games continue to change the Storytelling landscape ( I am a cinephile and hobbyist film-maker). I have been writing about these changes in the series: ["Tech Behind Storytelling"](/blog/tbs).

### The Blog
I have not made many posts to this blog recently. I was focused on building [Celluloid Journeys](https://www.instagram.com/celluloidjourneys/) - a new home for all storytelling discussions. While the [old posts](/blog/watchlist) will still remain, I plan to dedicate this blog primarily to write about my latest tech explorations starting with some of my work in Robotics.
