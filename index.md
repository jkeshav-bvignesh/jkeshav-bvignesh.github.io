I love to create elegant software. What do I mean by that? Efficiently designed and written software that doesn't get in your way to achieve what you want to do. There is a certain beauty to software where everything just falls into place. 

Let me explain a bit. From user experience to system design to performance, all of us are faced with a lot of challenges in the software we build and that's what makes it interesting! While building these pieces of software, we don't always write everything from scratch. We tend to use prebuilt libraries or frameworks. In almost every such case, we choose libraries that are easy to work with. Things that "don't get in your way". The software we build should also be like that!

That's the thing with software development. There's always new challenges, new things to learn and new opportunities. I also strongly believe that every piece of software should create measurable customer/user impact. It's an exciting field to be in and I am always up for discussions on software design, code quality and building interesting projects! I also write about stuff that I find interesting, technical and otherwise, [here](/blog).

### My Tech Stack
I primarily code in Python, while also developing some components in Java and C++. I have also worked significantly with the Robot Operating System (ROS). I also develop web user interfaces for the various applications using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and frameworks like JQuery and Angular. I constantly explore new domains and am currently looking at Game development. You can find more details about my professional experience in my [Resume](/CV/J_Keshav_Bhupathy_Vignesh_Resume.pdf). I also work on side projects in my free time. You can find out more about those [here](/personal-projects)

### Other Interests
I am a hobbyist magician and perform occasionally. I am also an avid cinephile and love watching & discussing films and tv shows. I also make short films once in a while.

### A Request
The site itself is being constantly updated with features and sections. If you find any usability issues or any problems in general, do get in touch or raise an [issue on Github](https://github.com/jkeshav-bvignesh/jkeshav-bvignesh.github.io/issues). It would be greatly helpful!
