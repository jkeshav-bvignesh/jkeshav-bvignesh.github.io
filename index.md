I love to create elegant software. What do I mean by that? Efficiently designed and written software that doesn't get in your way to achieve what you want to do. There is a certain beauty to software where everything just falls into place. 

Let me explain a bit. I currently work as a Senior software engineer at [Wipro Robotics](https://www.wipro.com/en-IN/innovation/robotics/). Here, I am primarily focused on the design and development of a software platform that can enable various activities including rapid application development. It's enabled via exposing a lot of reusable libraries and REST APIs. This is a prime use case for software that should never get in your way. If it did, no one will use it!  A platform like that provides a lot of interesting challenges - from user experience to performance - and that's what makes it interesting! And with every challenge there is a lot to learn!

That's the thing with software development. There's always new challenges, new things to learn and new opportunities. I also strongly believe that every piece of software should create measurable customer/user impact. It's an exciting field to be in and I am always up for discussions on software design, code quality and building interesting projects! I also write about stuff that I find interesting, technical and otherwise, [here](/blog).

### My Tech Stack
I primarily code in Python, while also developing some components in Java and C++. I have also worked significantly with the Robot Operating System (ROS). I also develop web user interfaces for the various applications using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and frameworks like JQuery and Angular. I constantly explore new domains and am currently looking at Game development. You can find more details about my professional experience in my [Resume](/CV/J_Keshav_Bhupathy_Vignesh_Resume.pdf). I also work on side projects in my free time. You can find out more about those [here](/personal-projects)

### Other Interests
I am a hobbyist magician and perform occasionally. I am also an avid cinephile and love watching & discussing films and tv shows. I also make short films once in a while.

### A Request
The site itself is being constantly updated with features and sections. If you find any usability issues or any problems in general, do get in touch or raise an [issue on Github](https://github.com/jkeshav-bvignesh/jkeshav-bvignesh.github.io/issues). It would be greatly helpful!
