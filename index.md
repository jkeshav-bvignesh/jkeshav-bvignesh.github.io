I love to create elegant software. What do I mean by that? Efficiently designed and written software that doesn't get in your way to achieve what you want to do. There is a certain beauty to software where everything just falls into place. 

From user experience to system design to performance, software engineering is filled with a lot of interesting challenges and new opportunities to learn. It's an exciting field to be in and I am always up for discussions on software design, code quality and building interesting projects! I also write about stuff that I find interesting, technical and otherwise, [here](/blog).

### Tech And Storytelling
Storytelling has evolved over the centuries and its obvious that the next evolution is going to be intertwined with tech. The most recent one being Immersive Games. What is next? My passion for storytelling and experience over the years in Computer Science areas such as Graphics, AI and Robotics has given me ideas on what such an evolution will look like. I track the evolution of storytelling and its future, in this series: ["Tech Behind Storytelling"](/blog/tbs)

### My Tech Stack
I work on the complete spectrum of things from UI, to backend to DevOps. I primarily code in Python, building things from Robot Orchestration Systems to System Apps to Microservices, while also developing some components in Java and C++. I also develop web user interfaces for the various applications using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and frameworks like JQuery and Angular. I have also worked significantly with the Robot Operating System (ROS).

I have also started exploring Game Development as there is a significant overlap with Robotics and it's ability to tell immersive stories. I also work on [side projects](/blog/personal-projects) in my free time. Feel free to contact me in case you need more details about my professional experience.

### Other Interests
I am a hobbyist magician and perform occasionally. I am also an avid cinephile and love watching & [discussing films and tv shows](blog/watchlist/). I also make short films once in a while.
