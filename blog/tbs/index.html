<b>The Tech Behind Storytelling (TBS)</b> is a series that looks at how Storytelling and Tech co-evolved together to make each other better.
This is a look at how advances, both in hardware and software, have made storytelling more interesting and immersive, through the eyes of a passionate storyteller who also happens to be an engineer.
