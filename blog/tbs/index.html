<b>The Tech Behind Storytelling (TBS)</b> is a series that looks at how Storytelling and Tech co-evolved together to make each other better.
This is a look at how advances, both in hardware and software, have made storytelling more interesting and immersive, through the eyes of a passionate storyteller who also happens to be an engineer.

<i><b>Note: </b>TBS will pick up early next year. I am experimenting with a new structure that combines video and text to discuss the advances of Storytelling in Cinema & Games</i>
