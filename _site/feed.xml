&lt;p&gt;I currently work as a Software Development Engineer in the Autonomous Robots Research Team (Smart Devices) at CTO, Wipro Limited. I am currently involved in the design and development of scalable and configurable robotic software modules. I primarily code in Python and mostly work with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and supporting software including Gazebo, Moveit! and RViz. I also design robot simulation environments to aid software development and testing. Click Here to Download my Resume&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2018. During this period, I had designed and developed a few robot prototypes including an AI powered Chessboard. I have worked in several projects in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Game Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than computer science I am also passionate about performing magic and being involved in films.I directed one short film and have worked as the script writer in many individual projects. I have also worked as a VFX/Graphics Designer and am proficient in skills involving video editing.&lt;/p&gt;
