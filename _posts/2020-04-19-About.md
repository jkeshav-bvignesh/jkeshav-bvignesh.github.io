<p>I currently work as a Software Development Engineer in the Autonomous Robots Research Team (Smart Devices) at CTO, Wipro Limited. I am currently involved in the design and development of scalable and configurable robotic software modules. I primarily code in Python and mostly work with the Robot Operating System (ROS) and supporting software including Gazebo, Moveit! and RViz. I also design robot simulation environments to aid software development and testing. Click Here to Download my Resume</p>
