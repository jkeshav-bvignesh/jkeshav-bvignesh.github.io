One of the things I was building towards when I started writing the "Tech Behind Storytelling" series in my blog, was about how Robotics is helping in shaping the current storytelling experiences and how it will define the future of Interactive storytelling experiences.

While my blog series has only just begun to document the role of computers in storytelling, here's a sneak peek at what that kind of future would look like.

Dubbed "Project Kiwi", Disney's Imagineering team has been developing a free-roaming robotic actor, a dynamic fully untethered bipedal humanoid robot. They recently revealed to the world what it looks like and it's an impressive feat in robotics!

This is an example of what I mean when I say "Robotics, AI, Mixed Reality and games will change the Storytelling landscape". The kind of robots I want to build someday!

Here's Disney Imagineering's "Project Kiwi":

The Tech Behind Storytelling Series will explore more in this area in the future
